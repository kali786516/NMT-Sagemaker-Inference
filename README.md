Streaming Machine Translation on Apache Flink pipelines leveraging Apache OpenNLP

The NMT model has been trained offline using a parallel WMT corpus for German and English, 
uses Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) to account for unseen vocabulary.
The model has been dockered into Sagemaker as a Flask app - honestly the performance is 
infinitely better if just deployed as an RPC server (gRPC), but... why not try something new.

Given the > 6 mins time to create a Sagemaker endpoint - its best to use 
Sagemaker only for model inference. For streaming model training - consider using Oryx2, PredictionIO
or Flink's Queryable State.

Better options for Streaming Model Training would be to leverage Pravega (http://pravega.io) 
or Flink's Stateful stream processing for realtime model updates.

## Building the Project

1. Fill twitter.properties with Twitter Developer OAuth Creds
2. Deploy the model into Sagemaker as a Docker container - 
    get that here  --> https://amazon.awsapps.com/workdocs/index.html#/folder/e811a3ed006b7bb0b88d46b6010d1d232c21f8f69030dfa56133ee7918bb18fa
   See the Readme file there for instructions on Sagemaker deployment
3. Specify the AWS Sagemaker endpoint and region in aws.properties 
    make sure you have your AWS creds locally
4. Run mvn package to generate a project jar
5. Start a Flink cluster - see https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.6/quickstart/setup_quickstart.html
6. From the Flink Dashboard UI - upload the jar generated in Step 2 and submit the same
    Main class = de.dws.berlin.StreamingNmt
